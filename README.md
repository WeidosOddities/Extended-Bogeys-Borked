## Disclaimer
 - **_This is an unofficial fork of Extended Bogeys, there will be bugs that might take a while to fix (I am very new to minercaft modding)._**
**_Meaning, that some issue may take longer than usual to fix, but I am and will be actively maintaining this fork until a stable official release for EB comes out_**

 - **If you have any issues, please use the issue tracker, or message Weido's Oddites on discord (dont bug the main devs, that won't fix the issues)**
