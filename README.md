# Extended Bogeys
[Forge & Fabric 1.18.2 & 1.19.2] A forge mod to add new bogey types to the Create Mod as well as providing a simple API for other mods to add their own easily and without conflict

## Features
Extended Bogeys primarily adds new types of bogey as well as an Interface for other mods to do the same, on top of this a new Unlinked bogey as been added allowing for more than two bogeys per carriage. Configurably, (disabled by default) speed, acceleration and minimum turn radii can be applied to each bogey making each one more unique.
